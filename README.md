# cross_slipping_dislocations
Show parts of the cross-slipping dislocations research

## Research calculations workflow
1. Design atom scale simulations
2. Execute parallel computations
3. Parse and transform resulting xyz coordinates data into graph data using OVITO
4. Extract via OVITO's API the dislocations analysis data into numpy *.npy data files
5. Analyse and visualize

## Purpose
To expose some of the core of my research in the field of dislocations.
